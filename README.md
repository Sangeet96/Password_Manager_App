# What I Learned
Throughout the development of CyberKey, I gained valuable experience in several areas:

Frontend-Backend Communication: I learned how to effectively implement and manage communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring smooth data flow within the app.

React Libraries: I explored and utilized various React libraries, such as react-toastify for notifications and React Icons for incorporating icons into the UI.

Database Management: I used MongoDB Atlas to store and manage the application's data, gaining experience in setting up and interacting with a cloud-based database.

Deployment: I learned how to deploy a full-stack application using Vercel, including handling environment variables and ensuring that both frontend and backend are correctly configured for production.
